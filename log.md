##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Just finished "Basic Front End Development Projects" on Free Code Camp, and will be starting the next section, Basic JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling super adept with Bootstrap, but I am starting to understand it better. Able to get thing to work the way I want more and more, without running to look it up every five minutes :) I definately am feeling more confident after doing these projects than I did even just a few days ago. Its so fun and exciting!

### Day 1: October 1, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Very excited to start on project for client, i started the framework, pulled some designs together, did some initial coding on it.

**Thoughts**: Up until now, all of the projects ive worked on have been for assignment or for fun, this is the first time doing it for someone else. Its a little daunting, but Ive got this!

**Link(s) to work**: Forgot to grab the link, and about to fall asleep, will add it tomorrow :)


### Day 2: October 24,2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on simple business webpage for client, so getting more practice with bootstrap and jQuery. 

**Thoughts** So many resources available to build with, and of course I found the perfect font for the design concept we are going for, and of course it was $39, couldnt be a free one on Google Fonts! well, i found the closest I could to use. Finding that there are a lot of templates and snippets, but trying to avoid them, I learn alot more writing the code myself, and through trial and error. Also, I find that I really lose track of time when I am working on something, sat down just to get started on the basic bare bones, and its now 5 hours later!
