##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Just finished "Basic Front End Development Projects" on Free Code Camp, and will be starting the next section, Basic JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling super adept with Bootstrap, but I am starting to understand it better. Able to get thing to work the way I want more and more, without running to look it up every five minutes :) I definately am feeling more confident after doing these projects than I did even just a few days ago. Its so fun and exciting!

**Today's Progress**: Very excited to start on project for client, i started the framework, pulled some.deigns together, did some initial coding on it.

**Thoughts**: Uo until now, all of the projects ive worked on have been for assignment or for fun, this is the first time doing it for someone else. Its a little daunting, but Ive got this!

**Link(s) to work**: Forgot ro grab the link, and about to fall asleep, will add it tomorrow :)
