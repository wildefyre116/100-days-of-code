### Day 0: October 10th, 2017
<!--
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Just finished "Basic Front End Development Projects" on Free Code Camp, and will be starting the next section, Basic JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling super adept with Bootstrap, but I am starting to understand it better. Able to get thing to work the way I want more and more, without running to look it up every five minutes :) I definately am feeling more confident after doing these projects than I did even just a few days ago. Its so fun and exciting!

### Day 1: October 1, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Very excited to start on project for client, i started the framework, pulled some designs together, did some initial coding on it.

**Thoughts**: Up until now, all of the projects ive worked on have been for assignment or for fun, this is the first time doing it for someone else. Its a little daunting, but Ive got this!

### Day 2: October 24,2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on simple business webpage for client, so getting more practice with bootstrap and jQuery. 

**Thoughts** So many resources available to build with, and of course I found the perfect font for the design concept we are going for, and of course it was $39, couldnt be a free one on Google Fonts! well, i found the closest I could to use. Finding that there are a lot of templates and snippets, but trying to avoid them, I learn alot more writing the code myself, and through trial and error. Also, I find that I really lose track of time when I am working on something, sat down just to get started on the basic bare bones, and its now 5 hours later!

### Days 3-10: October 25-November 1, 2017
**Progress**: I have continued to bumble through JS, and started building a Halloween web page, it isn't finished, but enjoying trying new concepts as I learn them, and even before I have learned them. 
**Thoughts**: I havent been logging like I should, but I am working. Was kind of stuck on what to practice coding, have been battling through a mental block learning JS. But sticking to it, and everyday it is getting a little clearer, but working on coursework (FreeCodeCamp, CodeAcademy, And the Odin Project concurrently) i am not getting as much coding in as I would like, I learn best by doing!
